# Templates

In Vue 3, a template is a part of a Vue component that defines the structure and layout of the user interface. Vue 3's reactivity system allows the template to automatically update whenever the data properties of the component change, without manually manipulating the DOM. This enables developers to create dynamic and reactive user interfaces with declarative and intuitive template syntax, making it easy to create interactive and responsive applications in Vue.js.
